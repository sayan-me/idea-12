# Learning Outcomes ‚Äì Project Idea 12: Multi-Tenant, Multi-Region Observability Platform

## Overview

This project prepares you for high-level DevOps and Cloud Architect roles by providing deep, hands-on experience across cloud-native technologies, GitOps, Kubernetes operators, service mesh, observability, security, and platform engineering.

---

## üß† Core Learning Outcomes

### 1. Cloud Architecture & Multi-Region Design

-   Design and deploy AWS multi-region architecture using Transit Gateway and peered VPCs.
-   Implement secure, cost-optimized networking strategies.
-   Manage multi-account, multi-environment Terraform deployments.

### 2. Kubernetes at Scale

-   Provision and manage production-grade multi-tenant Kubernetes (EKS) clusters.
-   Enforce namespace isolation, pod security standards, and resource quotas.
-   Extend Kubernetes with a custom operator (`tenant-operator`) built using Kubebuilder/Go.

### 3. GitOps & CI/CD Automation

-   Implement CI pipelines with GitHub Actions.
-   Build CD pipelines with Argo CD (App-of-Apps pattern, env-specific deployments).
-   Handle secrets, rollback, and automated destroy strategies.

### 4. Observability & Monitoring

-   Build an end-to-end observability platform: Prometheus, Thanos, Grafana, Loki.
-   Create tenant-specific dashboards and alerts.
-   Enable deep observability using eBPF tools (e.g., Cilium, Pixie).

### 5. Service Mesh & API Security

-   Use Istio for tenant-aware routing, traffic control, and mTLS.
-   Configure JWT authentication and RBAC policies using Keycloak.
-   Apply Istio AuthorizationPolicies for fine-grained access.

### 6. Kubernetes Security & Policy Management

-   Manage secrets with Vault Agent Injectors.
-   Apply policies with OPA/Gatekeeper.
-   Use Cilium for network segmentation and observability.
-   Use Wazuh for host-level monitoring and intrusion detection.

### 7. Developer Platform Engineering

-   Build a GitOps-first, self-service platform for tenant onboarding.
-   Automate infrastructure, service mesh, monitoring setup via a Kubernetes Operator.
-   Expose infrastructure provisioning via Crossplane (optional extension).

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time to Implement (Part-Time)

-   **Total Estimated Duration**: 12‚Äì16 weeks
-   **Workload**: \~2 hours per day (\~14 hours/week)
-   **Breakdown**:

    -   Week 1‚Äì2: Architecture planning, repo setup, AWS networking
    -   Week 3‚Äì4: Terraform modules, EKS clusters, Vault/Keycloak
    -   Week 5‚Äì6: Observability stack (Prometheus, Thanos, Loki)
    -   Week 7‚Äì8: Istio setup and tenant routing
    -   Week 9‚Äì10: GitHub Actions + Argo CD pipelines
    -   Week 11‚Äì12: Custom Operator development
    -   Week 13‚Äì14: Security (OPA, Vault, Cilium)
    -   Week 15‚Äì16: Finishing touches, dashboards, documentation

You can compress the timeline by working full-time or parallelizing components (e.g., security + observability).
